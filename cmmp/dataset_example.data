# this is a comment, '#' must appear at the beggining of the line

# empty lines are allowed

# each line is composed as such:
# in_1 in_2 in_3 ... in_n out_1

# this is a data line: {1, 2, 3, 4} are inputs and 5 is output
1 2 3 4 5

# all data lines must have the same number of inputs and an output, so the
# next line is valid:
   1.3245    123.321 123 0 -7534.123

# but this one wouldn't be valid (note: it is commented because it
# would give an error):
# 1 2 3 4

# more invalid lines (imagine the first # is not there):
 # comment must be at the beggining of the file !!!
